# CSS  Distribution

This repository is automatically synced with the main [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) repository to provide lightweight CSS only version of Semantic UI.

This package **does not support theming** and includes generated CSS files of the default theme only.

You can view more on Semantic UI at [LearnSemantic.com](http://www.learnsemantic.com) and [Semantic-UI.com](http://www.semantic-ui.com)




# UPDATE BY IORDAN 19 AUGUST 2021

The main files of Semantic UI have been replaced with the mail files for Fomantic UI v.2.8.8 -- see here: https://github.com/fomantic/Fomantic-UI/tree/2.8.8

The reason is that Fomantic UI is a community fork of Semantic UI and has many new features (for example, a really nice data picker) that are not included in the official Semantic UI library.
